      title: "All-on-4 Technique",
      description: "The All-on-Four technique uses only four dental implants to support a complete fixed prosthesis, ideal for patients without teeth or with compromised dentition. It provides rapid rehabilitation with stability, aesthetics, and chewing function in less time and with fewer surgical interventions."
    },
    {
      title: "Zygomatic Implants",
      description: "Zygomatic implants are indicated for patients with significant bone loss in the maxilla, where conventional implants are not viable. In this technique, dental implants are fixed to the zygomatic bone (cheekbone), providing secure support for prostheses and allowing oral rehabilitation without bone grafts."
    },
    {
      title: "Immediate Loading",
      description: "The immediate loading dental implant technique allows placement of the implant and dental prosthesis on the same day or within 72 hours after surgery, providing rapid recovery of aesthetics and chewing function. Ideal for selected cases, it offers more comfort and efficiency for the patient."
